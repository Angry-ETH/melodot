# Melodot

Melodot is a safer, more user-friendly, and cheaper data availability layer.

We adopt polynomial commitments to ensure the security of the data availability layer and introduce farmers and PoSpace to address the reliance on the Minimum number of honest nodes, as well as to solve the problem of "who reconstructs the data, who stores the data, and for how long." Additionally, this makes validators work like light clients, which is very beneficial for future sharding.

Currently, the project is under active development. You can learn more about Melodot in the initial draft [whitepaper](https://zerodao.notion.site/Melodot-Data-Availability-Layer-Whitepaper-b72b1f3de81c40fc94a56763756ce34a?pvs=4).
